# For this final SQL project, I'm querying a digital media store database with multiple tables in it to analyze information regarding artists, albums, media tracks, invoices, and customers.

#1. Show Customers (their full names, customer ID, and country) who are not in the US. (Hint: != or <> can be used to say "is not equal to").

SELECT 
 customers.firstname
,customers.lastname
,customers.customerid
,customers.country
FROM chinook.customers

WHERE customers.country<>'USA'

LIMIT 20;

#2. Show only the Customers from Brazil.

SELECT 
 customers.firstname
,customers.lastname
FROM chinook.customers

WHERE country ='Brazil';

#3. Find the Invoices of customers who are from Brazil. The resulting table should show the customer's full name, Invoice ID, Date of the Invoice, and billing country. 

SELECT 
 customers.FirstName
,customers.LastName
,invoices.invoiceid
,invoices.invoicedate
,invoices.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices

LEFT JOIN chinook.customers
ON invoices.customerid=customers.customerid

WHERE invoices.billingcountry='Brazil';

#4. Show the Employees who are Sales Agents.

SELECT 
 employees.firstname
,employees.lastname
,employees.title
FROM chinook.employees

WHERE employees.title= 'Sales Support Agent';

#5. Find a unique/distinct list of billing countries from the Invoice table.

SELECT DISTINCT invoices.billingcountry
FROM chinook.invoices;

#6. How many Invoices were there in 2009?

SELECT 
COUNT (*)
FROM chinook.invoices

WHERE invoicedate BETWEEN '2009-01-01' AND '2009-12-31';

#7. Provide a query that shows all the Tracks, and include the Album name, Media type, and Genre.

SELECT 
tracks.trackid
,tracks.name as TrackName
,albums.title as AlbumTitle
,media_types.mediatypeid
,genres.GenreId

FROM chinook.tracks
LEFT JOIN chinook.albums

ON tracks.AlbumId=albums.AlbumId

LEFT JOIN chinook.genres

ON tracks.genreid=genres.genreid

LEFT JOIN chinook.media_types

ON tracks.mediatypeid=media_types.MediaTypeId;
