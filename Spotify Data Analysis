-- For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
-- Then, I created a table to insert the Spotify data into.
-- Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

--Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

--Then, I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

--Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

--1. First, I found which tracks are the most acoustic. 

SELECT track_name
,artist_name
,acousticness
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

GROUP BY track_name
ORDER BY acousticness desc

LIMIT 10;

--2. Next, I wanted to know which artist had the most popular song track overall. 

SELECT artist_name 
,track_name
,popularity
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata 

WHERE popularity >85
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY popularity desc

LIMIT 10;

--3. Finally, I found which artists produced the songs with the highest energy. 

SELECT artist_name
,AVG(energy) AS avg_energy
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata

GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY avg_energy DESC

LIMIT 10;
